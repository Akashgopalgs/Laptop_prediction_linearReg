# Laptop Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting laptop prices based on various features, as well as a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.

### Project Overview
The aim of this project is to provide a tool that can estimate the price of a laptop given its specifications. The model is trained on a dataset containing laptop prices and various features such as company, type, operating system, screen size, RAM, weight, CPU, GPU, and storage type.

### Features
- *Machine Learning Model*: A linear regression model trained to predict laptop prices.
- *Streamlit App*: A user-friendly web application to interact with the model and make predictions based on user inputs.
- Data Preprocessing: Scripts to preprocess and scale input data for model compatibility

### Repository Structure
- laptop_price_model.pkl: The trained machine learning model serialized as a pickle file.
- feature_names.pkl: Pickle file containing the feature names used by the model.
- app.py: The Streamlit application script.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
